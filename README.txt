Installation instructions:

1. Open up your command prompt and navigate to the toolCloudProject/ directory within our code. You should be in the same directory that the manage.py file is located in.

2. Run the newSlate.py program by entering the command python3 newSlate.py. This will flush out the old database and repopulate it with some users, tools, and sheds that you can play around with.

3. Now in the same directory, run the command python3 manage.py runserver. This will start up the server on your localhost.

4. Open a web browser and enter localhost:8000 in the URL address box. This will bring you to the home page of our website. From here, you can try logging in with any of the following accounts that our newSlate.py program created for you. You can also instead make an account yourself by clicking “Register” but these are provided for easy access.
